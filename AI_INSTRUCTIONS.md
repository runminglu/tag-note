# Agent Instructions

This file is for AI coding agents working in this repository. `AGENTS.md` and
`CLAUDE.md` point here.

## Project

TagNote (`tsn`) is a self-hosted note-taking app built with Go, Fiber, SQLite,
and an embedded vanilla JavaScript frontend.

## Critical Safety Rules

### Never Destroy Docker Volumes

Never run:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker volume rm
```

The default Docker volume stores the SQLite database and user uploads. Use this
to stop containers safely:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If a fresh database is needed for testing, use a separate Compose project or a
temporary volume.

### Use Docker For Go Tooling

Do not run Go commands directly on the host. Use Docker:

```bash
docker build --target test .
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The Dockerfile `test` stage runs `gofmt -l cmd internal`, `go vet ./...`,
`go test ./...`, and `govulncheck ./...` with the pinned tool version declared
in the Dockerfile.

Run the app locally with Docker Compose, not `go run`:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

### Use Docker For Node Tooling

Do not install Node dependencies or Playwright browsers directly on the host.
Use Docker and run with the host UID/GID so generated files are not root-owned:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -e npm_config_cache=/tmp/.npm \
  -v "$(pwd)":/app \
  -w /app \
  node:22-alpine \
  npm install

docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --network host \
  -e npm_config_cache=/tmp/.npm \
  -v "$(pwd)":/app \
  -w /app \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.60.0-noble \
  npm run test:e2e
```

## Dependency Management

Use reproducible, pinned dependency versions. Do not use dynamic dependency
selection such as `@latest`, floating Docker tags, or unbounded version ranges
for project builds, CI, release scripts, or docs.

For Go dependencies:

- Add or update modules with Dockerized `go get module@version`.
- Commit the resulting `go.mod` and `go.sum` changes.
- Prefer the latest stable patched release that fixes the issue or provides the
  needed feature.
- Do not install Go tools on the host.

For test tools:

- Keep tool versions pinned in Docker-controlled paths.
- The Dockerfile `test` stage is the canonical backend quality gate.
- Do not run one-off `govulncheck@latest` commands when updating dependencies;
  update the Dockerfile pin intentionally and run `docker build --target test .`.

For npm dependencies:

- Use lockfile-based installs, including `npm ci` in CI and containers.
- Keep `package-lock.json` committed when npm dependencies change.

For automated updates:

- Prefer Dependabot or an equivalent reviewed PR workflow over dynamic runtime
  dependency resolution.
- Dependency update PRs must pass `docker build --target test .`, Docker image
  build, and E2E tests when relevant.

## Local Testing

Rebuild and restart the local stack:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Check logs:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=50
```

The app runs on port `3777`, mapped to container port `3000`.

When `TAGNOTE_TEST_MODE=1`, the test account is:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Email | `test@test.com` |
| Password | `testpass123` |

## Release Instructions

When asked to release `vX.Y.Z`:

1. Review commits since the last release.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with `Added`, `Changed`, and `Fixed` entries.
3. Update changelog comparison links.
4. Commit the changelog update.
5. Tag the commit with `vX.Y.Z`.
6. Run:

```bash
./release/deploy.sh vX.Y.Z
```

## Architecture

- Stack: Go 1.26, Fiber v2, SQLite via pure-Go driver, vanilla JavaScript, EasyMDE.
- Entry point: `cmd/tagnote-server/main.go`.
- Layers: handler -> service -> repository.
- Frontend: embedded files in `web/`.
- Auth: JWT, bcrypt passwords, magic links, Google OAuth.
- Data: users, notes, tags, settings, trash, uploads, and audit logs.

## Design & UX References

Before changing any TagNote UI — web app, marketing site, iOS app, or any
future client — read:

- [`design_docs/ux_guidelines.md`](design_docs/ux_guidelines.md) —
  cross-platform UX guidelines. Leads with a short Principles section
  (tag-first; four concepts; speed; calm/loud color; adapt don't
  duplicate; one product one feel; themed never hardcoded; trust; tone;
  a11y + offline). Then covers the surface model, adaptive behavior across
  phone/tablet/desktop/TV, cross-platform consistency rules, IA, the card
  model, the Focus authoring surface and save-status states, tag chips,
  the Importance × Urgency priority model, manage/trash/settings, auth
  paths, modals, toasts, buttons, forms, the 8-theme system, typography,
  iconography, input methods (pointer / touch / keyboard / D-pad / screen
  reader), the sanctioned animation budget, empty/loading/error states,
  offline/PWA posture, privacy, and the marketing-site section order.

Other design notes in `design_docs/`:

- `design_docs/autosave_notes.md` — autosave contract behind the
  save-status indicator.
- `design_docs/ios_app_design.md` — companion iOS app direction.
