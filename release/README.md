# Release Process

This directory contains scripts for building, deploying, rolling back, and
checking TagNote releases.

## Versioning

TagNote uses semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR`: breaking API, database, or operational changes.
- `MINOR`: backwards-compatible features.
- `PATCH`: bug fixes, documentation, and dependency updates.

Builds derive their version from the explicit script argument or from Git tags.

## Scripts

| Script | Runs On | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `release/build.sh` | Local machine | Build a Docker image with version metadata. |
| `release/setup.sh` | Local machine | First-time server directory and config setup. |
| `release/deploy.sh` | Local machine | Build, transfer over SSH, restart, and verify production. |
| `release/promote-staging.sh` | Local machine | Deploy to the staging Compose stack. |
| `release/rollback.sh` | Local machine | Restore the previous or specified image. |
| `release/status.sh` | Local machine | Check production health and container status. |
| `release/dashboard.sh` | Local machine | Show an operator dashboard. |
| `release/first_time_setup_grafana.sh` | Local machine | Install monitoring support. |
| `release/deploy_grafana.sh` | Local machine | Update monitoring configuration. |
| `release/status_grafana.sh` | Local machine | Check monitoring stack status. |
| `release/server/monitor-setup.sh` | Server | Install cron-based health checks. |

## Configuration

Edit `release/config.sh` or override values per command.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEPLOY_HOST` | `deploy@example.com` | SSH target for production. |
| `PROD_DIR` | `/opt/tagnote` | Production directory on the server. |
| `STAGING_DIR` | `/opt/tagnote-staging` | Staging directory on the server. |
| `IMAGE_NAME` | `tagnote` | Local Docker image name. |

Example override:

```bash
DEPLOY_HOST=deploy@notes.example.com ./release/status.sh
```

## Typical Release Flow

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Commit the release changes.
3. Tag the release.
4. Deploy to staging.
5. Validate the app.
6. Deploy to production.

```bash
git tag v1.3.2
git push origin v1.3.2

./release/promote-staging.sh v1.3.2
./release/deploy.sh --skip-build v1.3.2
./release/status.sh
```

To build and deploy production in one step:

```bash
./release/deploy.sh v1.3.2
```

## Deployment Model

The scripts build a Docker image locally and transfer it directly to the server
over SSH. No container registry is required.

```text
local Docker build
  -> docker save
  -> SSH transfer
  -> docker load on server
  -> update TAGNOTE_IMAGE in .env
  -> docker compose up -d tagnote
  -> verify /healthz
```

## Rollback

Use the image recorded before the last deploy:

```bash
./release/rollback.sh
```

Or specify an image explicitly:

```bash
./release/rollback.sh tagnote:v1.3.1
```

## Verification

```bash
./release/status.sh
./release/dashboard.sh
curl https://notes.example.com/healthz
```

Expected `/healthz` shape:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "v1.3.2",
  "db": true
}
```

## Monitoring

The release scripts support a small monitoring stack with Grafana and
VictoriaMetrics. See [../OPERATIONS.md](../OPERATIONS.md) for setup details.
